This program runs on jython and uses the Jython Music Library. Go to http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/jythonmusic/?page_id=23 to download the library and for instructions on how to run the program. Using the JEM editor that comes enclosed in the Jythno Music Library is the easiest option I have found for running this program.
